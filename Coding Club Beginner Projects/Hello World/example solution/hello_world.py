Possible questions and answers:
Q: What is a function?
A: A function is a set of instructions to the computer that can take an input 
    that you put in the parenthesis after calling a function.

Q: Why are there parenthesis after "print"?
A: The parenthesis are how we pass input, or "paremeters" to the functions. 
    Some functions need input and others don't. Here, we pass the sentence
    "Hello World!" to the print function as input.

Q: Why do we need quotation marks around "Hello World!"?
A: The quotation marks are how we let Python know that we're typing a sentence (string of characters).
